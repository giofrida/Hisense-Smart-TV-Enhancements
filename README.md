# Hisense-enhancements: a collection of enhancements for Hisense Smart TVs

These modifications edits user-writable files on your TV. It should not cause any damage on your television. However, **I take no responsibility if anything goes wrong!**

**Make a backup of the original files you are going to replace!** The modified files are stored in a user-writable partition on the TV. Therefore, you can recover them at any moment if you did a backup of the original files first.

These modification *should* work on most 2016/2017 Hisense models:
* H43/49M3000     *(the 43" model is the one I own)*
* H40/50/55M3300  *(untested)*
* 40/50MEC3350    *(untested)*
* 40/50EC591      *(untested)*
* 65M5500         *(untested)*
* 55M6600         *(untested)*
* 55/65M7000      *(untested)*
* 55/65MEC7050    *(untested)*

As of 12 July 2017, I only tested my modifications on the H43M3000 model. If you decide to give them a try on your TV, please let me know if it has worked or not.

## Installation ##
First of all, you need access to the FTP interface of your television. It's quite easy to do using a UART to USB interface. I have written a small guide on xda-developers: [click here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=68737765&postcount=84)

In order to apply the modification, you can clone the repository and then execute the batches: you will find the needed files in the folder "release" newly created. Alternatively, you can grab the files below. After that, connect to your Hisense TV via FTP and navigate to the folder <code>/3rd_rw/UI/hisenseUI/</code>. Transfer the files and test the modification!

If you want the modded file browser replace these files:
* <code>[mediaIndex.html](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giofrida/Hisense-enhancements/master/UI/hisenseUI/mediaIndex.html)</code>
* <code>css/[fileBrowser.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giofrida/Hisense-enhancements/master/UI/hisenseUI/css/fileBrowser.css)</code>
* <code>modulePages/himedia/[fileBrowser.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giofrida/Hisense-enhancements/master/UI/hisenseUI/modulePages/himedia/fileBrowser.js)</code>
* <code>modulePages/himedia/[natural-compare.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giofrida/Hisense-enhancements/master/UI/hisenseUI/modulePages/himedia/natural-compare.js)</code>
* <code>tempString/[hiMediaString.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giofrida/Hisense-enhancements/master/UI/hisenseUI/tempString/hiMediaString.js)</code>

If you want the modded video player replace these files:
* <code>css/[videoPlayer.css](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giofrida/Hisense-enhancements/master/UI/hisenseUI/css/videoPlayer.css)</code>
* <code>modulePages/himedia/[videoPlayer.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/giofrida/Hisense-enhancements/master/UI/hisenseUI/modulePages/himedia/videoPlayer.js)</code>
